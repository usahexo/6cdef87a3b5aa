Different gardens will require different levels of care and attention, depending on the plants that are being grown and the climate in which they are situated. However, there are a few basic tips that can help you get your garden looking good – no matter what condition it’s in!</p>
<p>One of the most important things to remember when cleaning your garden is to take into account the time of year.

<ol>
<li><p>Remove any clutter or debris from the area. This includes sticks, stones, leaves and other bits and pieces that can be a hindrance to plant growth.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sweep or hoe any loose soil from around the plants. This will help them to grow better and look neater.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inspect the plants for any signs of damage or disease, and take corrective action where necessary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>deadheading by removing faded flowers from plants such as roses can help stimulate further blooming.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If needed, add some organic compost or fertilizer to improve the quality of the soil. Not only will this help the plants to grow better, but it will also reduce weed growth in the area.</p>

<ol>
<li>It keeps pests and diseases at bay.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of keeping your garden clean is that it helps to keep pests and diseases at bay. If there is too much clutter or debris lying around, it can provide an ideal environment for these organisms to thrive in. Cleaning your garden regularly will help to reduce the risk of them attacking your plants.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It improves air quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great benefit of cleaning your garden is that it helps to improve the air quality. When leaves and other organic matter start to decompose, it gives off a range of toxins that can be harmful to both humans and animals. By clearing away all of the debris, you’re helping to get rid of these toxins and improve the air quality in your garden.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>It makes gardening easier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cleaning your garden also makes gardening easier, as you won’t have to deal with all the clutter hindering you from getting started. You’ll be able to move around more easily and access all the areas of your garden with ease. This will make it simpler for you to care for your plants and landscape them in the way you want.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It keeps weeds at bay.</li>
</ol>
<p>Weeds are another nuisance that can be eliminated through regular garden cleaning. Weeds love growing in areas that are cluttered and have a lot of debris lying around, so by removing all this extra material, you’re making it more difficult for them to take hold. This means you’ll spend less time battling against weeds and more time enjoying your beautiful garden!</p>
